# ðŸš€ Real-Time Stream Processing with Azure Stream Analytics & Event Hubs

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete real-time data streaming pipeline using **Azure Stream Analytics**, **Azure Event Hubs**, and **Azure Storage**. The solution processes simulated sales orders as they are ingested, aggregates them in time-based windows, and stores the results for analytics â€” all in real-time.

## ðŸ§  What I Did

- Set up a **real-time event stream** using Azure Event Hubs and a simulated order generator
- Configured an **Azure Stream Analytics job** to consume event data from Event Hubs and output to Blob Storage
- Defined a **streaming query** using windowing functions to aggregate incoming data based on product ID and time intervals
- Delivered the transformed results to **JSON files** in Azure Data Lake for downstream analytics or archiving
- Monitored the job in action and validated the output across multiple time windows

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to design and deploy **real-time data processing pipelines** with minimal latency
- The power of **windowing and aggregation** in stream analytics for producing actionable insights
- Best practices for **connecting, querying, and storing streaming data** using Event Hubs, Stream Analytics, and Blob Storage
- Hands-on experience with **end-to-end data flow orchestration** in Azure â€” from ingestion to storage
